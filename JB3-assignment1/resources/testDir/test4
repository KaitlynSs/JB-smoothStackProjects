     A Java program is a sequence of Java instructions that are executed in a certain order. 
Since the Java instructions are executed in a certain order, a Java program has a start and 
an end.

     To execute your Java program you need to signal to the Java Virtual Machine where to 
start executing the program. In Java, all instructions (code) have to be located inside a Java 
class. A class is a way of grouping data and instructions that belong together. Thus, a class 
may contain both variables and methods. A variable can contain data, and a method groups 
together a set of operations on data (instructions). Don't worry if you do not fully understand 
this yet. It will be explained in more details in later texts.
